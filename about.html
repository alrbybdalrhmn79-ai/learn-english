                <h3>🎯 Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    At TalkFluent, we believe that speaking English fluently should be accessible to everyone.
                    Our mission is to provide practical, actionable tips that help learners build confidence
                    in real-world English conversations, from casual chats to professional discussions.

                <h3>📖 Our Story</h3>
                <p>
                    TalkFluent was born from the frustration of traditional language learning methods that
                    focus too heavily on grammar rules and vocabulary lists. We noticed that many learners
                    could read and write English well, but struggled with natural, flowing conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing from real-world experience and extensive research into effective language
                    acquisition, we created a resource specifically designed to bridge that gap between
                    textbook knowledge and conversational fluency.
